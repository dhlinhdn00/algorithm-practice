# Algorithm Practice

This repository is dedicated to my journey of improving problem-solving skills and mastering algorithms. It contains solutions to various algorithmic problems from platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and LeetCode. Most of the solutions are implemented in Python.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories for each platform, with further subdirectories for problem difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) where applicable. For example:

- **CodeChef**
- **CodeForces**
- **GeeksforGeeks**
- **HackerRank**
- **LeetCode**

## Goals for 2025

Starting from 2025, I aim to consistently work on algorithmic problems every day. This will help maintain discipline and improve my proficiency over time.

### Progress in 2025

- **03 January 2025**: [LeetCode/Easy/Maximum Score After Splitting a String](./LeetCode/Easy/Maximum%20Score%20After%20Splitting%20a%20String)

### Notes

- Solutions from previous years (2024 and earlier) are also part of this repository.
- I'll continue to add more problems and solutions as I progress in 2025.
- Feel free to explore and suggest improvements or alternative approaches!
